### Buttons/Widgets
1. This is the folder you put the RAW images in.
2. Where images go to after clicking the NEXT (8) button. They are only moved when you click this button. Over-sight on my part.
3. This is where the finished card will appear. \n
** BUTTONS 4 AND 5 ONLY UPDATE TO CANVAS WHEN YOU PRESS ENTER! **
4. Type the character name here. Long names might spill, no fixes for this. Skip the character and send them to me.
5. This box is where youll put the anime name.
