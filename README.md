### Buttons/Widgets
1. This is the folder you put the RAW images in.
2. Where images go to after clicking the NEXT (8) button. 

>They are only moved when you click this button. Over-sight on my part.

3. This is where the finished card will appear.
4. Type the character name here. Long names might spill, no fixes for this. Skip the character and send them to me.
5. This box is where youll put the anime name.

>BUTTONS 4 AND 5 ONLY UPDATE TO CANVAS WHEN YOU PRESS ENTER!
>
>Double click the text boxes to delete them.

6. Image scale

> -100 to 100. Scales image up or down in constrained proportions.

7. This starts the program.

> **Do not press start until you have place all the images you want to convert into the TODO folder. Internal list is only updated when this button is pressed.

8. This will go to the next image.

> Do not press this button until you SAVE (7). Restart the program if you do.

9. Saves the current canvas (10) layout.

> Moves finished card to the FINISHED CARDS folder.

10. This is the canvas workspace, all images and text will appear here.

> You can only manipulate the RAW image in the canvas via mouse dragging. The image can only be dragged by the parts of the image sticking out from behind the card template. If you can't move the image try making it larger and try again.
